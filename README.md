### Scripts to reproduce my Tara Oceans analysis

Clone the respository and run the `runme.bash` script. Dependencies are `python3` and `scikit-learn`.

The figure below was created by drawing the histogram from `inf_clustercount.tsv` and ARI graph from `adjusted_rand_index.tsv` in Excel then manually editing in Inkscape.
